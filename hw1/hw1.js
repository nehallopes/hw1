/*** 
 * 
 * Directions:
 * 1. Extract hw1.zip
 * 2. In the hw1 directory you'll find a hw1.js and hw1.test.js file. hw1.js is the only file you need to modify.
 * 3. Open hw1.js in VS Code, or your preferred text editor or IDE.
 * 4. Implement all the TODOs described in commments below and save your work.
 * 
 * 
 * Validating your changes:
 * 1. Ensure you have Node.js LTS or newer installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 * 2. Open cmd or terminal, change directory (cd) to the location of your hw1 directory.
 * 3. Once inside the hw1 directory, execute the following command: npm install
 * 4. The above command will install the jest dependency which will allow you to execute the unit tests in hw1.test.js
 * 5. Execute the following command to validate your changes in hw1.js are working as expected: npm test
 * 6. You will see output indicating the tests have passed or failed; if you see failures, there is an issue with your implementation
