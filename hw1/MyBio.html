              Hello everyone, My Name is Nehal Lopes and I'm currently pursuing my master’s degree here at DePaul University in Computer Science. I have completed my bachelor’s degree in information technology and have more than a year of experience working as a Database Administrator at Accenture. My Future goal is to become a Full stack developer. I have Basic knowledge about Node and React. I also have some hands-on experience working on HTML, CSS, and JS during my Web Development internship. I’m excited to learn new things here and grow as a Full stack developer. A class group chat would be helpful for everyone, and my preference would be Discord over Slack.
